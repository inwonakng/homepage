# Inwon's Homepage


This is a fork of [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). I've changed a few things, including appearance, mobile rendering (TOC), additional contents (reading), and how tags are managed.

I made this site during summer of 2023. I'm still not sure if this is the most futureproof solution, but it's served me well for around a year now. However, the `contentlayer` package is deprecated, so it will start breaking at some point. But most of the content is in markdown so I'll find something else when the time comes.
