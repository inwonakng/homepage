# Summary

Use a decoder-only language model to do classification on tabular data by _serializing_ the data to text.

# Contributions

- A comparison study of different serialization techniques for tabular data.

# Approach

## Target Task

Classification

## Experiment Scale

Datasets with at most 50,000 rows and 30 columns.
12 datasets.

## Input Transformation

_text_: convert everything into text -- i.e. `the *column* is *value* ...`
_list_: a text "list" of values -- i.e.

    ```
    - *column1*: *value1*
    - *column2*: *value2*
    ...
    ```

Row to text:

- Only values
- Mismatching column name/values
- Matching column name/values
- First 10 features

# Findings

- (Sometimes) Outperforms TabPFN and XGB on a few-data regime.

## Text serialization comparison

Compared _text_ vs. _list_ serialization.

- _text_ is better in general.
- However, there was a dataset that _list_ was better in.
