# Single file case
`:s` is the command to do search and replace on nvim.
The basic syntax is `:s/old/new/g` where `old` is the string to be replaced and `new` is the string to replace with.
The `g` at the end is to replace all occurrences of `old` with `new`.
If `g` is not used, only the first occurrence of `old` will be replaced with `new` at each line.

You can also specify the range of lines to do the search and replace.
Using `%s/old/new/g` will replace all occurrences of `old` with `new` in the entire file.

You can also specify a range of lines to do the search and replace by visual selection.
First enter visual mode by pressing `v` and then select the lines you want to do the search and replace on.
Then type `:s/old/new/g` and press enter.

You can use regex for your matches, and may also specify case insensitivity by prepending `\C` (case sensitive) or `\c` (case insensitive) to the search term, depending on your default setting.

## Using case sensitivity
If you find that you need to jump around your command, you can press `ctrl+f` to open the command in a buffer.
This allows you to enter normal mode and also check your previous commands.

# Multi file case
You can do multi-file search and replace by using the popular [`spectre`](https://github.com/nvim-pack/nvim-spectre) plugin for nvim.
But if you already of a fuzzy file finder such as [`fzf-lua`](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) or [`telescope.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), you can achieve the same without needing an extra plugin.
In fact, this also allows you to select which files to perform the mass search-and-replace on with more ease.
I use fzf-lua, so I will cover this case. But telescope will be very similar.

1. First enter the `live_grep` mode by pressing your binding or typing in `:lua require("fzf-lua").live_grep()`.

2. Type in your search term.

3. Select the files you want to do the search and replace on by pressing `tab` on each file.

4. Press enter to open the selected files in the quickfix window.

5. Type `:cdo` and then the same syntax as the single file case (e.g. `%s/old/new/g`).

6. If you want to save the changes, type `:wa` (write all open buffer) or `:cdo w` (write all in quickfix) to write all the files.

  - If you want to revert the changes, you can also type `:cdo u` to undo the changes.
