# What are macros?
A marco is a sequence of vim actions that you can record for re-using.

# Why use macros?
Consider the following case (this is extremely contrived but still):
Let's say that you have a function like this.

```python
def a_function(
    parameter_a: int,
    param_b: float,
    another_param_c: float,
) -> None:
  ...
```

Let's now say that you want to pack the arguments of `a_function` into a dictionary while keeping the names, like the following.

```python
{
  "parameter_a": parameter_a,
  "param_b": param_b,
  "another_param_c": another_param_c,
}
```

You can achieve this manually, but you will (hopefully) notice that you are using the same keystroke for every line (every parameter).
This is a good example of where macros can come in handy.

For each line, you can achieve the transformation by the following keystokes: `0vec""<ESC>Per=2bye$bvep`.

## Breakdown
- `0`: Go to begining of line.
- `vec`: Visually select until end of this word and trigger `change` to enter input mode while copying the selected word.
- `""<ESC>P`: Put two quotation marks, go to norma mode, and paste before the last quotation mark.
- `er=`: Go to end of word and replace with =.
- `2bye`: Go back 2 words and copy the word (stuff inside quotation marks).
- `$b`: Go to the end of the line and back one word.
- `vep`: Select until the end of the word and paste to overwrite.

# Using macros in vim
You can "record" macro by pressing `q` followed by a letter (a-z) and then the sequence of keystrokes you want to record.
You can then replay the macro by pressing `@` followed by the letter you used to record the macro.

For example, you can you can press `qh` to record a macro for `h` and execute your first line, then repeat them in the next line by pressing `@h`.

# Using multi-line macros
Cool, but you still have to repeat the macro for each line.
Surely there is a better way?

You can achieve multi-line macros by selecting the target lines and using the following command (press `:` to start a command).
```
'<,'>norm @h
```
Where `norm` is short for `normal`.
And the `'<,'>` is a range that specifies the visual selection.
If you used visual selection, this part should already be populated, so you just need to type `norm @h` and press enter.
