Submission to the [Chainlink Constellation Hackathon 2023](https://chain.link/hackathon).
I worked with my advisor Oshani and our group member Tripp Lyons on this project.
We implemented a supply chain solution using Circom's ZKP circuits to where the seller can verify their ability to meet the buyer's request without revealing any information about their supply.
This project used the BSC's testnet and Ethereum's Sepolia testnet.
I worked on the cross-chain communication and some parts of the frontend demo for this project.
We used Chainlink's [CCIP protocol](https://docs.chain.link/ccip) to implement the cross-chain communication.
